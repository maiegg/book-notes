# Fundamentals of Data Engineering

## Ch 1. What is DE?
+ *data lifecycle engineer* = unencumbered by historical frameworks or technologies, capable of low-level programming tasks, but bringing value in higher-order ways like security, ops, architecture, orchestration [10]
+ Data maturity and management [14]
	+ Starting: architecture is key, get stakeholder buy-in and clearly articulate the value you want from data. Visible successes are key. Use off-the-shelf solutions when possible.
	+ Scaling: main bottleneck is not infrastructure, but a team. Key to remain focused on the practical utility of data.
	+ Leading: Automation, specialization, and always-availability. Custom tools have their biggest payoff here. Focus on the "enterprisey" stuff.
	+ backwards movement is possible - continuous focus on maintenance and improvement [17]

**Key responsibilities of a DE [18]:**
Know how to communicate with nontechnical people.
Understand how to scope business and product requirements.
Understand the cultural foundations of Agile, DevOps, and DataOps.
Control costs.
Learn continuously.

Type A and Type B DE's: Abstraction vs. Build. [22]

## Ch 2. The Data Engineering Lifecycle
Five stages:
+ Generation
+ Storage
+ Ingestion
+ Transforamtion
+ Serving

And a bedrock of *undercurrents*: Security, Data management, DataOps, Data architecture, Orchestration, and SWE
